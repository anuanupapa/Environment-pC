* Decision Making
  *lambda* is neighbor wealth visibility.
  *delW* is the Avg wealth of neighbors subtracted from wealth of focal player.
** Cooperative environment
   p_{C} = p_{0} - b + tanh(lambda*delW)
** Defective environment
   p_{C} = 1 - (p_{0} - b + tanh(lambda*delW))
* PGG
**  Modified PGG
   Each cooperator donates *m* to each of her neighbors. Each player receives *r*m* from each of her cooperative neighbors. 
* Rewiring
  All possible pair of players are given an option to either retain/break or create/abstain links with the partner player with a probability *re*.
